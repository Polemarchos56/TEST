    <h1>The History of Efstathios Loupas and how I met him</h1>
    <p>
      On November 5th, 2021, I met Mr. Efstathios Loupas for the first time. I
      was a new student in his zoom classroom, and I was immediately struck by
      his enthusiasm and energy. From the very beginning, it was clear that Mr.
      Loupas was passionate about teaching and genuinely cared about his
      students' success.
    </p>

    <p>
      His teaching style was engaging and interactive, and he always made sure
      to provide plenty of opportunities for students to ask questions and
      participate in class discussions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, Mr. Loupas has continued to be an inspiring and dedicated
      teacher, and I can honestly say that he is the best teacher I have ever
      had. His impact on my education and my life is immeasurable, and I am
      grateful for the opportunity to have learned from him.
    </p>
